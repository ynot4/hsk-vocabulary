You are able to select which HSK Levels to display words from, and choose between **Standard Mandarin or Taiwanese pronunciation** and **Yale or Jyutping romanisations** for Cantonese.

## Documentation:

The program runs from a single executible file, ***hsk-vocabulary.exe***, so no installation is required. When first opened, a folder is created in ***Documents\\(ynot)\\hsk-vocabulary*** to store the configuration files, you can delete them if uninstalling.
